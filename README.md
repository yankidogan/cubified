# Cubified
 A simple game made using Unity game engine.
 
 The goal is to let the cube pass through the incoming walls by breaking the cubes in the walls. After each wall, an additional cube is added to the travelling cube, so players should open a hole in incoming walls in the shape of the travelling cube to let it pass through.
